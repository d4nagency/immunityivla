# NAD+ IV Therapy Westwood — Energy & Cellular Health

Westwood stands at the intersection of intellectual excellence, medical innovation, and sophisticated urban living. Home to UCLA's renowned medical center, this vibrant Los Angeles neighborhood attracts professors, medical professionals, tech entrepreneurs, and students who understand the science behind optimal health. In this community where evidence-based wellness meets busy professional lifestyles, NAD+ IV therapy has become the go-to solution for those seeking genuine cellular rejuvenation and sustained peak performance.

NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is a vital coenzyme present in every living cell, essential for energy metabolism, DNA repair, and maintaining cellular health. Research shows NAD+ levels decline by approximately 50% by age 40 and up to 80% by age 60, contributing to fatigue, cognitive decline, reduced metabolic function, and accelerated aging. Our Westwood NAD+ IV therapy restores these critical levels, helping you maintain the mental clarity and physical vitality your demanding lifestyle requires.

## Understanding NAD+ Therapy for Westwood Residents

### The Science Behind the Treatment

NAD+ is not a trend—it's a fundamental molecule for human health. Here's what Westwood's scientifically-minded residents should know:

**Energy Production** — NAD+ is essential for mitochondrial function, converting nutrients into cellular energy (ATP). Declining levels mean less energy at the cellular level.

**DNA Repair** — NAD+ activates sirtuins and PARPs, proteins that repair DNA damage and maintain genomic stability. This is crucial for healthy aging.

**Cognitive Function** — NAD+ supports neuronal health, neurotransmitter production, and may help protect against age-related cognitive decline.

**Metabolic Health** — NAD+ plays a critical role in metabolic regulation, influencing how your body processes nutrients and maintains healthy weight.

### What to Expect During Treatment

NAD+ IV therapy is a comfortable, relaxing experience:

1. **Consultation** — Our nurse reviews your health history and treatment goals
2. **Comfortable Setup** — Settle in at home while we prepare your personalized infusion
3. **Slow Infusion** — NAD+ is administered gradually for comfort and optimal absorption
4. **Monitoring** — Your vital signs are monitored throughout the treatment
5. **Post-Treatment** — Most clients feel energized and clear-headed immediately

Many Westwood clients report improved mental clarity, sustained energy, better sleep quality, and enhanced overall wellbeing following NAD+ therapy.
