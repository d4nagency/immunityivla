## Why Calabasas Residents Choose NAD+ IV Therapy

### The Science of Cellular Rejuvenation

NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) is a coenzyme found in every cell of your body and is essential for cellular energy production, DNA repair, and overall metabolic function. Unfortunately, NAD+ levels decline naturally as we age — dropping by up to 50% by age 40 and continuing to decrease thereafter. This decline is associated with:

- Reduced energy and fatigue
- Cognitive decline and brain fog
- Slower metabolism and weight gain
- Accelerated aging at the cellular level
- Decreased athletic performance and recovery
- Weakened immune function

Our NAD+ IV therapy directly replenishes these declining levels, bypassing the digestive system for maximum absorption and immediate cellular impact.

### Perfect for the Calabasas Lifestyle

Calabasas residents understand the value of investing in their health. Our mobile NAD+ IV service is particularly popular among:

- Stress resilience for demanding schedules
- Mental sharpness for high-stakes decisions

**Active Adults and Fitness Enthusiasts**
From morning hikes at Calabasas Peak to tennis matches at the Calabasas Tennis & Swim Center, active residents use NAD+ for:
- Improved athletic performance

## Frequently Asked Questions — Calabasas NAD+ IV Therapy

**How long does NAD+ IV therapy take?**
Standard 500mg treatments take 2-3 hours. High-dose 1000mg protocols require 3-4 hours. The slow infusion ensures optimal tolerance and absorption.

**How quickly will I feel results?**
Many clients notice improved mood and mental clarity during or immediately after treatment. Energy and cognitive benefits typically peak within 24-48 hours and can last 1-4 weeks depending on your metabolism and lifestyle.

**Is NAD+ IV therapy safe?**
Yes, when administered by licensed professionals. Our California-licensed RNs and NPs have extensive NAD+ experience. We conduct health screenings before treatment and monitor you throughout the infusion.

**How often should I get NAD+ IV therapy?**
This varies by individual goals. For anti-aging maintenance, monthly treatments are common. For performance optimization or recovery, weekly or bi-weekly sessions may be recommended initially. We'll create a personalized protocol during your consultation.

**Can I work during my NAD+ infusion?**
Absolutely. Many Calabasas clients take calls, answer emails, or conduct virtual meetings during their treatment. We recommend having a comfortable setup with your laptop, tablet, or phone within reach.

**Do you service gated communities?**
Yes, we regularly serve clients in The Oaks, Mont Calabasas, and other gated Calabasas communities. Provide gate codes or security instructions when booking for seamless entry.

**What's the difference between oral NAD+ supplements and IV therapy?**
Oral NAD+ has poor bioavailability — most is broken down by digestion before reaching your cells. IV therapy delivers NAD+ directly into your bloodstream for 100% absorption and immediate cellular availability.

**Can NAD+ help with specific health conditions?**
While NAD+ therapy supports cellular health broadly, many clients report benefits for fatigue, brain fog, metabolic concerns, and age-related decline. NAD+ is not a treatment for specific diseases but supports your body's natural regenerative processes.
