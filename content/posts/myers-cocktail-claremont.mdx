From the historic Claremont Village to the sprawling campuses of the Claremont Colleges, residents here value education, wellness, and quality of life. Our mobile Myers' Cocktail IV therapy brings the classic vitamin and mineral infusion directly to Claremont homes, supporting the health-conscious lifestyle that defines this exceptional Inland Empire community.

Claremont attracts professors, students, professionals, and families who prioritize both mental and physical well-being.

## Why Claremont Residents Choose Myers' Cocktail IV Therapy

### The Foundation of IV Vitamin Therapy

Myers' Cocktail represents the gold standard in nutritional IV therapy. Developed by Dr. John Myers in the 1960s, this precise formulation has supported wellness for over six decades. The carefully balanced blend includes:

- **Magnesium** — Essential for muscle function, nerve transmission, and energy production
- **Calcium** — Critical for bone health, cardiovascular function, and cellular signaling  
- **B-Complex Vitamins** — Complete spectrum including B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, and B12 for metabolic and neurological support
- **Vitamin C** — Powerful antioxidant supporting immune function and collagen synthesis

Unlike oral supplements that face absorption challenges in the digestive tract, Myers' Cocktail delivers nutrients directly into your bloodstream for 100% bioavailability. Your cells receive immediate access to these essential building blocks for optimal function.
