## Why Studio City Residents Choose NAD+ IV Therapy

### The Science of Cellular Rejuvenation

NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) is a coenzyme found in every cell of your body, playing a critical role in energy production, DNA repair, and metabolic function. As we age, NAD+ levels naturally decline — dropping by up to 50% by age 40 and continuing to decrease with each passing year. This decline contributes to many symptoms we associate with aging:

- Persistent fatigue and low energy
- Cognitive decline and mental fog
- Slower metabolism and weight management challenges
- Visible signs of aging in skin and appearance
- Reduced athletic performance and recovery time
- Compromised immune function

Our NAD+ IV therapy replenishes these declining levels directly, bypassing the digestive system for maximum absorption and immediate cellular impact. The results can be transformative — sustained energy, mental clarity, and a renewed sense of vitality that oral supplements simply cannot match.

### Perfect for the Studio City Lifestyle

## How NAD+ IV Therapy Works

### The Cellular Restoration Process

NAD+ is involved in over 500 enzymatic reactions in your body. When delivered intravenously, it immediately becomes available to your cells for:

**Energy Production** — NAD+ is essential for converting nutrients into ATP, your cells' energy currency. Higher NAD+ levels mean more efficient energy production at the cellular level.

**DNA Repair** — NAD+ activates sirtuins, proteins that repair DNA damage and maintain cellular integrity. This is crucial for slowing the aging process and preventing age-related diseases.

**Metabolic Health** — NAD+ supports healthy metabolism, helping your body efficiently process nutrients and maintain optimal weight.

**Cognitive Function** — Brain cells require enormous amounts of energy. NAD+ supports neuronal health, neurotransmitter production, and overall brain function.

**Detoxification** — NAD+ supports your body's natural detoxification pathways, helping clear cellular waste and environmental toxins.

## FAQ: NAD+ IV Therapy in Studio City

**How is NAD+ different from other IV therapies?**
NAD+ is a coenzyme that works at the cellular level to support energy production, DNA repair, and metabolic function. While vitamin IVs provide nutrients, NAD+ actually helps your cells function more efficiently and can address the root causes of fatigue and aging.

**How quickly will I feel results?**
Many clients report increased energy and mental clarity within hours of their first treatment. However, the full benefits of NAD+ therapy develop over time, with cumulative effects from regular treatments. Most clients see optimal results after 3-5 sessions.

**Is NAD+ therapy safe?**
Yes, when administered by licensed healthcare professionals. NAD+ is a naturally occurring substance in your body. Our nurses conduct health screenings before treatment and monitor you throughout the infusion. Side effects are typically mild and may include temporary flushing or mild nausea.

**How long do the effects last?**
Individual results vary, but most clients experience benefits for 2-4 weeks after a single treatment. Regular maintenance treatments help maintain optimal NAD+ levels and sustained benefits.

**Can I combine NAD+ with other treatments?**
Absolutely. NAD+ therapy pairs well with our immune boost, hydration, and vitamin IV therapies. Many Studio City clients create custom wellness protocols combining multiple treatments for comprehensive health support.

**Do you offer package pricing?**
Yes, we offer discounted packages for clients committing to regular NAD+ therapy. Monthly subscription plans provide the best value for those incorporating NAD+ into their ongoing wellness routine.

**Can I get NAD+ therapy at my office?**
Yes, with proper accommodations and privacy. We provide NAD+ therapy at production offices, home offices, and other Studio City workplaces. The infusion takes 2-4 hours, so plan accordingly.

**Is there anyone who shouldn't get NAD+ therapy?**
NAD+ therapy is generally safe for healthy adults. However, we do not treat pregnant or breastfeeding women, individuals with certain heart conditions, or those with specific contraindications. Your nurse will review your health history before treatment.

**What's the difference between oral NAD+ supplements and IV therapy?**
Oral NAD+ supplements have very poor absorption rates — often less than 10% reaches your bloodstream. IV therapy delivers 100% bioavailable NAD+ directly to your cells, making it far more effective.

**Will my insurance cover NAD+ therapy?**
Generally, NAD+ therapy is considered elective wellness rather than medically necessary treatment. We provide itemized receipts for those seeking HSA/FSA reimbursement, but cannot guarantee coverage.
