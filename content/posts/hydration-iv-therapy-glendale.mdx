## Frequently Asked Questions — Glendale Hydration IV Therapy

**How do I know if I need hydration IV therapy?**
Signs of dehydration include persistent thirst, dark urine, fatigue, headache, dizziness, dry mouth, and decreased urination. If you're experiencing these symptoms, especially after physical activity, heat exposure, or during busy periods, IV hydration can provide rapid relief.

**How quickly will I feel better?**
Most Glendale clients report significant improvement within 30-60 minutes. Full hydration benefits are typically realized within 2-4 hours, with sustained energy and wellness effects lasting days.

**How long does a treatment take?**
The infusion takes 30-45 minutes for one liter of fluids. From arrival to departure, expect approximately 60-75 minutes for your complete appointment.

**Is mobile IV therapy safe?**
Absolutely. Our California-licensed RNs and NPs conduct thorough health screenings before treatment and monitor you throughout. We use only sterile, single-use equipment and follow all medical protocols.

**Can I get treatment at my office?**
In many cases, yes. Contact us to discuss workplace treatments, especially for corporate teams or during demanding work periods.

**How often should I get hydration IV therapy?**
This varies by individual needs. Busy professionals often benefit from monthly maintenance, fitness enthusiasts may prefer weekly treatments during active periods, and others schedule as-needed for recovery or preparation.

**Will my insurance cover IV therapy?**
While we don't bill insurance directly, we provide detailed receipts for HSA/FSA reimbursement. Some clients receive partial reimbursement depending on their plan.

**What's the difference between drinking water and IV hydration?**
When dehydrated, your digestive system may not absorb fluids efficiently. IV hydration bypasses the GI tract entirely, delivering fluids directly to your bloodstream for 100% absorption and immediate cellular availability.

**Do I need a doctor's referral?**
No referral needed. Our licensed clinicians evaluate your needs and provide appropriate treatment during your appointment.
