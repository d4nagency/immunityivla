## Frequently Asked Questions — Los Feliz Myers' Cocktail

**What makes Myers' Cocktail different from other IV therapies?**  
Myers' Cocktail is the original preventive IV therapy, developed by Dr. John Myers in the 1960s. It provides a balanced, comprehensive blend of essential vitamins and minerals that support overall wellness rather than targeting specific symptoms. It's ideal for maintenance, prevention, and general health optimization.

**How often should I get Myers' Cocktail IV therapy?**
This depends on your lifestyle and goals. Many Los Feliz clients choose monthly maintenance treatments, while those in intensive creative periods or training cycles may benefit from weekly sessions. We can help you establish an optimal schedule based on your specific needs.

**Is Myers' Cocktail good for anxiety or stress?**
The magnesium and B-vitamins in Myers' Cocktail support nervous system function and can help with stress resilience. Many clients report feeling calmer and more centered after treatment. However, IV therapy should complement, not replace, appropriate mental health care.

**Can I get treatment at my creative studio or workspace?**
In many cases, yes. We can accommodate treatments at home offices, private studios, and some commercial spaces. Contact us to discuss your specific location and requirements.

**How does Myers' Cocktail support creative work?**
The B-vitamins are essential for neurological function, energy production, and neurotransmitter synthesis. Many creative professionals report improved focus, sustained energy, and mental clarity following treatment. The magnesium supports calm, steady energy rather than jittery stimulation.

**Will I feel immediate effects?**
Most clients report a sense of well-being and improved energy within hours of treatment, with peak benefits occurring 24-48 hours post-infusion. Unlike caffeine or sugar, the effects are steady and sustained rather than a spike followed by a crash.

**Is it safe to get Myers' Cocktail regularly?**
Yes, Myers' Cocktail is safe for regular use. The vitamins and minerals are water-soluble (with the exception of some minerals), meaning your body uses what it needs and excretes the rest. Many clients have maintained regular Myers' Cocktail schedules for years with excellent results.

**How does mobile IV therapy work in apartments and condos?**
Our clinicians work efficiently in all living spaces. We respect your space, work quietly, and require only a comfortable chair and small table. Most treatments take 45-60 minutes from arrival to departure.
