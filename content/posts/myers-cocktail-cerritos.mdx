## Why Cerritos Residents Choose Myers' Cocktail IV Therapy

### The Original Wellness IV

Myers' Cocktail represents the foundation of modern IV vitamin therapy. Developed by Dr. John Myers in the 1960s, this precise formulation has helped countless individuals address energy depletion, immune challenges, and overall wellness concerns. The classic blend includes:

- **Magnesium** — Essential for muscle function, nerve transmission, and energy production
- **Calcium** — Critical for bone health, cardiovascular function, and cellular signaling
- **B-Complex Vitamins** — Including B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, and B12 for energy metabolism and neurological health
- **Vitamin C** — Powerful antioxidant supporting immune function and collagen synthesis

Unlike oral supplements that must navigate the digestive system with limited absorption rates, Myers' Cocktail delivers these nutrients directly into your bloodstream. This intravenous administration ensures 100% bioavailability — meaning your cells receive the full therapeutic benefit immediately.
