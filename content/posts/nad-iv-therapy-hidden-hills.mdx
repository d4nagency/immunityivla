## Why Hidden Hills Residents Choose NAD+ IV Therapy

### The Gold Standard in Cellular Rejuvenation

NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) is a vital coenzyme present in every cell of your body, playing a crucial role in energy production, DNA repair, and metabolic function. As we age, NAD+ levels naturally decline — falling by approximately 50% by age 40 and continuing to decrease with each passing year. This decline contributes to:

- Persistent fatigue and low energy
- Cognitive decline and memory issues
- Reduced metabolism and unwanted weight gain
- Visible signs of aging
- Decreased physical performance
- Compromised immune function

Our NAD+ IV therapy restores these critical levels directly, bypassing the digestive tract for complete absorption and immediate cellular benefits. For Hidden Hills residents accustomed to the finest things in life, this represents the most effective investment in cellular health available today.

## What to Expect During Your Hidden Hills NAD+ Session

### Consultation and Planning

Every treatment begins with a brief consultation to understand your health goals, review any medications or supplements you're taking, and customize your NAD+ protocol. This can be conducted via phone or in person at your Hidden Hills home.

### The Infusion Experience

Your nurse will set up comfortable seating with everything needed for a relaxing session. Many clients choose to:
- Catch up on reading or scripts
- Take business calls (hands-free)
- Enjoy music or meditation
- Simply rest and recharge
- Work on a laptop or tablet

The infusion itself is comfortable, with most clients reporting only a mild warming sensation or temporary flushing, both signs that the NAD+ is actively working in your system.

### Post-Treatment Benefits

Many Hidden Hills clients report feeling the effects of NAD+ therapy immediately, with benefits including:
- A noticeable energy lift within hours
- Improved mental clarity the following day
- Better sleep quality that night
- Enhanced mood and reduced anxiety
- Continued improvements over the following weeks with regular treatments

## Understanding NAD+ Science

### Why IV Delivery Matters

Oral NAD+ supplements face significant challenges: stomach acid degradation, poor intestinal absorption, and first-pass liver metabolism that dramatically reduces bioavailability. IV administration delivers 100% of the NAD+ directly to your cells, ensuring maximum therapeutic benefit.

### The Cellular Mechanisms

NAD+ supports your body through multiple pathways:

**Sirtuin Activation**
NAD+ activates sirtuins, often called "longevity genes," which regulate cellular health, DNA repair, and metabolic function.

**Mitochondrial Support**
Your cellular powerhouses require NAD+ to produce ATP — the energy currency that fuels every bodily function.

**DNA Repair**
NAD+ activates PARP enzymes that detect and repair DNA damage, critical for preventing cellular aging and mutation.

**Circadian Rhythm Regulation**
NAD+ helps regulate your body's internal clock, supporting healthy sleep-wake cycles and metabolic timing.

## Hidden Hills NAD+ Therapy: Investment in Longevity

### Treatment Frequency Recommendations

**Initial Loading Phase:**
For those new to NAD+, we recommend 4-6 treatments over 2-3 weeks to saturate cellular NAD+ levels and establish a foundation for optimal function.

**Maintenance Protocol:**
Most Hidden Hills clients maintain benefits with monthly or bi-monthly treatments, adjusted based on individual response and lifestyle factors.

**Intensive Protocols:**
For specific goals — preparing for a demanding project, recovering from illness, or optimizing for an important event — more frequent treatments may be recommended.

### Long-Term Benefits

Regular NAD+ therapy has been associated with:
- Slower cellular aging markers
- Reduced risk of age-related cognitive decline
- Better metabolic health and weight management
- Enhanced physical performance maintenance
- Improved stress resilience
- Stronger immune function
